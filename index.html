                                    In the school computer lab - one of the first in the U.S. - they take advantage of bugs in the
                                    time
                                    scheduler to obtain free computer time. They have their privileges revoked, but are allowed
                                    back when
                                    they offer to fix the bugs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They also write a class scheduling program, in which Bill ensures he would share classes with
                                    the most
                                    interesting girls, and together they start Traf-O-Data, reading traffic data for engineers.

                                    While not considered successful - losing $3,494 in the end - Bill and Allen gain experience
                                    simulating microprocessors,
                                    which will contribute significantly to their next venture.

                                    MITS' Altair 8800 is the first successful personal computer. Bill recognises its potential
                                    early, knowing
                                    it's powerful enough to support an interpreter for BASIC - one of the most popular languages at
                                    the time.
                                    Racing to beat competition, Bill and Allen call MITS before having started to make their offer,
                                    which is accepted.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Using tools from Traf-O-Data, Allen simulates the Altair's chipset while Bill writes 8800
                                    assembly by hand on legal pads.
                                    Two other Harvard students - Paul Gilbert and Monte Davidoff - also help with the project.

                                    Despite developing with only a simulated chipset, and Paul finishing the program on the plane
                                    to MITS, it works perfectly.
                                </p>

                                    Bill and Allen license the first general purpose programming language for a personal computer
                                    to MITS, and start calling
                                    their ventures "Micro-Soft".

                                    Bill and Allen's relationship has become tumultuous. Despite Allen spearheading the deal with

                                    for Microsoft, Bill believes his work on BASIC entitled him to a 60-40 split of the company.

                                    business manager Bill hired at Microsoft -
                                    discuss plans to dilute his shares by issuing options to themselves and the other shareholders.

                                    More than 14 million Americans use libraries computer and Internet access, over 2/3rds of which
                                    are people with lower income and education levels.
                                    Additionally, The Foundation works with Libraries for the Future to strengthen librarians'
                                    capacities for community outreach.

                                The world's richest person with an estimated worth of $62 billion, Warren Buffet pledges to give
                                the foundation 10 million Berkshire Hathaway
                                Class B shares spread over multiple years, with the first year's contribution being worth around
                                $1.5

                                    Buffet sets three conditions; that Bill or Mellinda must be alive and active to the
                                    foundation's administration, it must continue as a charity,
                                    and each year it must give away an amount equal to the intial gift, plus an additional 5% of
                                    its net assets.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This final condition is effectively a matching contribution, doubling the foundation's annual
                                    grants. In 2018, Buffet continues his
                                    contributions with another $2 billion in Berkshire stock.

                                    Immunisation is one of the most feasible and cost-effective way of ensuring children survive
                                    and thrive in good health.
                                    Because of its power and efficacy, renewed efforts are being made globally to immunise all
                                    children and develop new vaccines for
                                    the remaining killer diseases.

                                    DPT3 is the third and final dose of vaccinations that prevent diphtheria, pertussis (whooping

                                    three deadly but preventable diseases. The percentage of children receiving DPT3 is one metric
                                    of how well countries
                                    are providing immunisation coverage to their children.

                                    The World Health Organisation defined a 90% national DPT3 coverage rate by 2020 as one of the
                                    Global Vaccine Action Plan's goals.
                                    In 2017, the coverage rate averaged an estimated 88.13%.
